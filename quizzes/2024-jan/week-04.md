    if sum(row) != expected:
      return False
  for j in range(r):

**5) The "Masked Gun" game is a simple guessing game where the player attempts to unlock a masked gun by correctly guessing a secret 4-digit code. Arrange the steps in the correct sequence to create a Python code for a game.**
**1) Implement Game Loop:**
**- Set up a loop for the main game logic.**
**2) Display Masked Gun:**
**- Create a function to visually represent the masked gun.**
**3) Generate Secret Code**
**- Write a function to generate a random 4-digit secret code.**
**4) Provide Feedback and Manage Attempts for Guessing**
**- Display feedback based on the correctness of the guess and keep track of the number of attempts left for guessing**
**5) End Game:**
**- End the game when the player correctly guesses the code or runs out of attempts.**
**Step 6) Validate and Compare Guess with Secret Code**
**- Check if the entered guess is a 4-digit numeric code and compare the player's guess with the generated secret code.**
**Enter your answer as a sequence without commas (NAT):**
**(Hint: Use the Logic like Guess the Movie game discussed in the lecture)**

Answer entered: `321645`

**6) To implement a magic square, we use the concept of matrices. Select all the statements that are True in this context.**

- [x] NumPy is one of the standard libraries associated with implementing matrices.
- [ ] Implementation of matrices is only through lists in Python.
- [ ] None of the above

**7) Consider the given dataset of 60 people born in 2000. Run your code using the given data to check the count of people whose birthdays fall exactly on a Tuesday.**

**8) What is the output of the following snippet of code?**
**Hint:**
**1. If L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then L[1: 3] is the list [2, 3]. Slicing a list is very similar to slicing a string. All the rules that you h… to list-slicing.** *(right edge cut off in the recording)*
**2. If P = [1, 2, 3] and Q = [4, 5, 6] then P + Q is the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Again, list concatenation is very similar to strin…** *(right edge cut off)*

```python
L = [90, 47, 8, 18, 10, 7]
S = [L[0]]      #list containing just one element
for i in range(1,len(L)):
    flag = True
    for j in range(len(S)):
        if L[i] < S[j]:
            before_j= S[:j]#elements in S before index j
            new_j= [L[i]] #list containing just one element
            after_j=S[j:] #elements in S
                          #starting from index j
            # what is the size of S now?
            S = before_j + new_j + after_j
            # what is the size of S now?
            flag = False
            break

        S.append(L[i])
print(S)
